# calfinated
calfinated.js is a node module that provides string-based templating and token replacement.

The initial purpose is to replace the usage of the no longer maintained markup.js dependency
for use by hyperpotamus.

## Why the name?
Given the theme of hyperpotamus, a baby hippo is called a "calf".
